Weather widget.It can be placed on any page.The widget has to work with the home location,but has to have possibility 
of choosing another city.Use LWC.

The wizard has to work with https://openweathermap.org/api. You can use design from google,but it has to be a lightning design.

Should create a Custom Metadata Type with a text field for storing a default city.If the current user haven't field the city,the 
widget should get the city from the CM record.

You have to consider choosing another city and then refresh the component.It should be great if you find some free icon pack 
and use it in the widget.
